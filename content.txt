You can't sit inside a bar this year, but you can make the Albatross Pub's mulled wine at home.

Ingredients:
1 (750 ml) bottle of dry red wine
1 orange
8 whole cloves
2 cinnamon sticks
2 star anise 
optional: 3-4 allspice berries, a grating of fresh nutmeg
2-4 tablespoons sugar, honey, or maple syrup to taste
1/4 cup brandy 
optional garnishes: citrus slices (orange, lemon and/or lime), extra cinnamon sticks, extra star anise

Using vegetable peeler, carve large ribbons of peel from the orange, then juice it. Combine all ingredients in a large saucepan and stir to combine (McGee recommends putting all your whole spices in a tea ball for easy removal). Let it barely reach a simmer on medium-high heat, but don’t let it bubble (or you’ll boil off the alcohol!). Reduce heat to low, cover and let the wine simmer for at least 15 minutes or up to 3 hours. 
Strain out the whole spices and orange peel before serving (or simply remove the tea ball). Enjoy!
